Social Media Username Browser

This project is a website where users can browse through usernames of well-known social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Users can select a username and the social media network, and the website displays the comments made by other users about that username.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to help users understand who the owner of a social media account is and whether they can be trusted. For example, if someone follows an account on Instagram and wants to communicate with the account owner via direct message but the account is private, the user can use this website to learn more about the account owner based on comments made by others.

## Team Members

This project was developed by a team of four people, with each member contributing equally:

* Nebi Peker Celik
* Yigit Demirsan
* Betul Seyhan
* Egemen Iscan

## Usage

When users open the website, they are taken to the home page, where they can choose between two buttons:

* "Add Comment": Users can add comments to the website by registering and logging in.
* "Show Comments": Users can view comments added by others without registering or logging in.
If a user clicks on "Add Comment" without logging in, they will be routed to the registration page. If the user is already registered, they can choose the "Login" button instead.
